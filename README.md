# Hello

This is a Ruby on Rails tutorial project I started over eight years ago. The last commit was in December 2014. It’s unfinished, probably broken, and sadly, I no longer remember anything I might have learned back then! Recently though, between learning JS, React and everything else on the SOC bootcamp, I’ve started to re-learn Ruby from scratch. Really, the only reason I’m keeping this repo up is because it shows just how long I’ve been interested in learning to code! I’m so glad I finally decided to chase my dreams :)
